# Linnaean Library Classification System 
## **Section 1.0**: Kingdom Detail Reference Guide 

### 1.1 **Project Overview:** 
Personal library organization system based on biological Linnaean taxonomy, integrated with analog Zettelkasten methodology. 
### 1.2 **Document Purpose:**
**REFERENCE:** To provide a comprehensive reference for the four-kingdom classification structure, providing detailed definitions, phylum breakdowns, and classification criteria for each knowledge domain.
**CLEAR DIVISIONS:** This document provides a high-level view and understanding of the different Kingdoms and provides for clean separations.  The basic breakdown of the different Kingdoms are as follows.
- **PHILOSOPHIA**: _Why_ questions (meaning, existence)
- **SCIENTIA**: _What_ questions (empirical reality)
- **PRACTICA**: _How_ questions (technical application)
- **ARS**: _Expression_ questions (cultural meaning)
### 1.3 **Innovation:**
First known application of complete Linnaean hierarchical structure (Kingdom > Phylum > Class > Order > Family > Genus > Species) to personal library organization with integrated note-taking system. 
### 1.4 Four-Kingdom Foundation and Overview  
- **2.1:** PHILOSOPHIA (Blue) - Fundamental understanding through rational inquiry 
- **2.2:** SCIENTIA (Green) - Empirical investigation of natural phenomena 
- **2.3:** PRACTICA (Red) - Technical application to concrete problems 
- **2.4:** ARS (Purple) - Cultural expression and meaning-making

### 1.5 How to Use This Document 
1. **For Classification Decisions:** Use the Classification Test (section x.x.5) for each kingdom 
2. **For System Understanding:** Review Essential Questions (section x.x.4) to grasp kingdom focus 
3. **For Cross-References:** Check Distinguishing Characteristics (section x.x.3) for boundary cases 
4. **For Implementation:** Reference Fundamental Domains (section x.x.2) for phylum-level organization.

## **Section 2.0:** Complete Kingdom Structure with Detailed Definitions

### 2.1 PHILOSOPHIA Kingdom Definition

**PHILOSOPHIA** - _Blue shelf labels_. _The pursuit of fundamental understanding through rational inquiry_

**Summary**
- **Core characteristic**: Questions of meaning, existence, knowledge, and values
- **Focus**: Metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, logic, aesthetics
- **Examples**: Plato's Republic, epistemology texts, moral philosophy

#### 2.1.1 Core Characteristics

**Primary focus**: Questions that cannot be resolved through empirical observation alone, requiring rational analysis, logical argument, and reflective thinking about the nature of reality, knowledge, and human experience.

#### 2.1.2 Fundamental Domains (Phylum)

**Metaphysica** - Reality, existence, being, causation

- What exists? What is the nature of reality?
- Questions of consciousness, free will, time, space

**Epistemologia** - Knowledge, belief, certainty, uncertainty

- How do we know what we know?
- Limits of knowledge, skepticism, truth

**Ethica** - Morality, values, right action

- How should we live? What is good?
- Virtue, duty, consequences, moral reasoning

**Logica** - Reasoning, argument, inference

- Valid thinking, fallacies, formal logic
- Methods of rational analysis

**Aesthetica** - Beauty, art, taste, experience

- Philosophy of art, aesthetic judgment
- Nature of beauty and artistic meaning

#### 2.1.3 Distinguishing Characteristics

**PHILOSOPHIA differs from:**

- **SCIENTIA**: Uses rational argument rather than empirical testing
- **PRACTICA**: Seeks understanding rather than technical application
- **ARS**: Analyzes rather than creates cultural expression

#### 2.1.4 Essential Questions

_Why does anything exist? How can we know truth? What makes actions right or wrong? What is the good life? How should we reason about complex problems?_

#### 2.1.5 Classification Test

If a book primarily addresses these fundamental questions through rational inquiry and philosophical argument, it belongs in **PHILOSOPHIA**.

**Psychologia** - Mind, behavior, cognition

- Psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience
- Behavioral studies, mental processes
- Human and animal behavior research

**Sociologia** - Social systems, institutions, culture

- Sociology, anthropology, social psychology
- Cultural studies, group behavior analysis
- Social research methodologies

#### 2.2.3 Distinguishing Characteristics

**SCIENTIA differs from:**

- **PHILOSOPHIA**: Uses empirical testing rather than pure rational argument
- **PRACTICA**: Seeks theoretical understanding rather than immediate application
- **ARS**: Discovers rather than creates cultural meaning

#### 2.2.4 Essential Questions

_How does the natural world work? What patterns govern physical and biological systems? How can we test and verify our understanding? What universal laws explain observed phenomena?_

#### 2.2.5 Classification Test

If a book primarily seeks to understand natural phenomena through empirical investigation, scientific method, or theoretical framework development, it belongs in **SCIENTIA**.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 2.3 PRACTICA Kingdom Definition
